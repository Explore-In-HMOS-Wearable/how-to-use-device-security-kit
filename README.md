# How to Perform a Local System Integrity Check with Device Security Kit?
This codelab demonstrates how to verify device security in HarmonyOS using the `checkSysIntegrityOnLocal` API of Device Security Kit.
System integrity checks help detect risks such as jailbroken or non-real devices. Based on the result, your app can decide how to proceed with its services.
